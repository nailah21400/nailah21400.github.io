Research indicates that race, ethnicity, type of insurance, and english proficiency are associated with worse health outcomes, access to healthcare and quality of providers. Little is known about the disparities in health outcomes for individuals with speech, language, and swallowing disorders. This study seeks to investigate potential associations between health outcomes for patients with speech, language, and swallowing disorders based on english proficency, race, and type of insurance.This project aims to provide the following analysis: Descriptive stats will describe the frequency of speech codes throughout the data set by insurance type, race, and English proficiency and a summary stats of health outcomes; Chi-square test: check relationship between insurance type, race, English proficiency and health outcomes; and ANOVA: compare mean health outcomes by insurance type, race, and English proficiency.
The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) is a set of survey questions for individuals, families, and their corresponding medical providers across the United States. Medical employers and insurance company data was also included. This survey was conducted by the Agency for Healthcare Researcha and Quality (AHRQ) and United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).
The MEPS collects data on health services used, the frequency of use, and expenditures of the services. The Household Component (HC) gathers interview data from a nationally representative sample of families and indiviudals over a two year period. The Insurance Component (IC) data is on what health care plans private and public employers offer to their employees. The Medical Provider Component (MCP) is supplemental data on the health care providers, hospitals, physicians, and pharmacies identified by the family and individual participants. The MEPS has data avaialble for 1996-2023.
